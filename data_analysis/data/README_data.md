# Data

## Introduction
These datasets are data for both WE:PLATINUM and CE:CATALYST_TEST aswell as WE:CATALYST_TEST and
CE:CATALYST_TEST.

## Data
The raw data begins at line 62. Before that is general information about
the test.


## External dependencies
There is two dependencies needed to parse the data that aren't
included in the standard installation of Anaconda. I will include a small 
guide below about how to install new Python3 libraries. This will be just
enought to install those two dependencies however and if you want/need to 
know more please look at https://pip.pya.io for the full pip documentation.


## Installation guide


### Unix:

-- Open your terminal app, if you are on a linux system try pressing
Ctrl-Shift-t. 

-- Type in the following:
	
	pip install pandas
	pip install galvani
done.

### Trouble shooting:

-- Sometimes pip is reffered to as pip3 in the termial.

### Windows:

-- I don't have a Windows machine so I have no idea how to install new Python3
packages. If I were to guess those same commands might work but since I don't 
have a computer running Windows and won't go throught the trouble of either installing
it on my machine or emulate it on a wm. I leave it to you to figure it out.
